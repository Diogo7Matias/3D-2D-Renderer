# 3D / 2D Renderer

A C++ project serving as an introduction to graphics programming. <br>
It covers fundamental concepts for generating 2D and 3D images.

<i> I intend to expand this project over time. </i>
## 3D | List of features:
- RayTracing Algorithm
  
## 2D | List of features:
- Line Drawing Algorithm
- Function for drawing filled triangles
- Zbuffer to avoid rendering pixels that shouldn't be visible
- Rendering Models (from .obj files) using the methods above
